  <h1>True facts about the mantis shrimp</h1>
  <p> Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed. They have large complex eyes and are highly coloured.</p>

  <h2>Attack </h2>
  <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong> spearers or smashers.</strong></p> 
     They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves </p>
  
  <h3> Eyesight </h2>
  <p> Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. </p> 
   The mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both polarized light, and colour vision outside the normal visual spectrum. </p>
